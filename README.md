This repository contains the code for a secure file sharing system!

This is a file sharing and access control system that uses cryptographic techniques such as RSA OAEP, HMACS, Hashes, PRNGS, Digital Signatures, and more to ensure security of files and user actions. It's data storage and retrieval system allows for bandwidth-optimized sharing of uncompromised and integrious information! Moreover, this system was designed to incoporate a secure communication channel for file invitations between users and features an access revocation system for file owners. 

This project also features an extensive testing suite under the "client_unittest.go" file.
